- Support multiple halos for multiple players, each having the same or custom halos?
- Add overseer hologram (that appears in sandbox editing mode) as ring?
- Semi-transparent halos
- Enable/disable player glow with configurable colors
- If config is reset, don't reset "hasRanBefore" variable
- Echo rags match color of halo or slugcat
- MSC lightning size configurable
- Add (General Systems Bus/Guardian) gear/chain graphics to paused or stunned objects, check The Seeker mod pearls
=== Forget list ===:
- More Oracle halo customization of sprites and bits
- Option to keep lightning active on certain objects
- New (constant?) lightning based on hologram shader
- Revive shockwave auto size with bigger creatures
- Extract Oracle halo lighting from Oracle halo, and optionally apply this for all halos?
- Guardian ring, maybe keep cursor on a paused or stunned object
- Add a manually enable think ring every time option, so when game restarts, halo is disabled
- Use CleanSpritesAndRemove for SpriteLeaser?
- When dragging players, try to shoot lightning forwards, so it looks like the lightning is dragging the player
- If main player is destroyed or killed, move halo to next player?
